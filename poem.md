# ~~The Unusual Way~~

**There was once a little man**, and his rod and line he took,<br>
For he said, "I'll go a-fishing in the neighboring brook." <br>
And it chanced a little maiden was walking out that day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they met, *in the usual way.*

Then he sat him down beside her, and an hour or two went by,<br>
But still upon the grassy brink his rod and line did lie;<br>
"I thought," she shyly whispered, "you'd be fishing all the day!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he was, *in the usual way.*

So he gravely took his rod in hand, and threw the line about,<br>
But the fish perceived distinctly that he was not looking out;<br>
And he said, "Sweetheart, I love you!" but she said she could not stay:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she did, *in the usual way.*

Then the stars came out above them, and she gave a little sigh,<br>
As they watched the silver ripples, like the moments, running by;<br>
"We must say good-by," she whispered, by the alders old and gray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they did, *in the usual way.*

And day by day beside the stream they wandered to and fro,<br>
And day by day the fishes swam securely down below;<br>
Till this little story ended, as such little stories may, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very much--*in the usual way.*

And now that they are married, do they always bill and coo?<br>
Do they never fret and quarrel as other couples do?<br>
Does he cherish her and love her? Does she honor and obey?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, they do, *in the usual way.*
